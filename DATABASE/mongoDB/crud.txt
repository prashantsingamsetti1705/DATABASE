CRUD
Create:
create database: use database-name
create collection: db.createCollection("name")
insert a document: we can insert document in two ways:
    i. insertOne : db.collection-name.insertOne
({Title:"Bahubali",year:2015})
    ii. insertMany : db.collection-name.insertMany
 ([{Title:"Bahubali2",year:2018},{Title:"pushpa",year:2022},
{Title:"vikram",year:2023}])

Read:
read all datadases:show dbs;
read all collections: show collections;
read all documents: db.collection-name.find()
read documents with specific filter:db.collection-name.find({"Title":"pushpa"})

update:
to do update, we need to select document and  change with a condition. There are two possible ways
  i. updateOne: it updates only first document that matched the condition.
     db.collection-name.updateOne({"Tilte":"vikram"},{$set:{"Title":"vikram2"}})
  ii. updateMany: it updates all the documents that matches the condition.
    db.collection-name.updateMany({"Tilte":"vikram"},{$set:{"Title":"vikram2"}})

delete:
delete specific documents: db.collection-name.deleteMany{(filterobject)
db.movies.deleteOne({"Title":"pushpa"}) -- it will delete only first document with title "pushpa"
db.movies.deleteMany({"Title":"pushpa"}) -- it will delete all documents with title "pushpa"
