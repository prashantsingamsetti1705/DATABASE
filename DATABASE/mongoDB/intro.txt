Mongodb is a popular noSQL, document based ,schemas-less database that is used to store flexible data easily. it provides high performance and scalability
 
 eg: ecommerce, social media, gaming

no SQL means non structured query languages. schema less means no structure. document based means every detail is a document
create a student details using mongodb:

{
    name:"prasad",
    email:"a@a.com"
},
{
    name:"john"
    email:'b@b.com
    phni:3233
}


Here databases are schemas, 
each table is called collection,
each value/row of a table is called document
each column is called  fields
