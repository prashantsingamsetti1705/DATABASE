1. what is database?
   Database is  where the data is stored. Here we can store and recover our data securily.
To manage databases, we use DBMS(database management system).
There are several Types of DBMS:
    I. file management system: Here database connects as files
      eg: MS access
    problems:  1. large aount of data cannot be stored
                      2.  lot of time for queries
                      3. redundancy(repetition)

   2. Relational Database Management System:
        Here data stores in the form of tables and each table maintains relationship with other table.
    advantages: 1. no redundancy
                        2. data will be organized and faster for queries
                        3. small and medium level enterprises
    disadvantages: 1. large amount of data maintainence will be difficult
                             2. unstructured data/schema-less(non-structured) cannot be entered.

   3. NoSQL: it stores the data in the form of trees,graphs,nodes,documents etc..,
    
2. what is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
     DBMS store the data in files and rdbms stores the data in tables
     DBMS have no relations and RDBMS tables are related /connected to each other
     DBMS have redundancy and RDBMS have no redundancy
     DBMS is used for single user or small group of people
     RDBMS is used for small or medium enterprises
3. what is SQL,mySQL and difference?
    SQL(structured Query Language) is a language used to write queries for RDBMS. Instructions/commands given to DBMS to perform a task is called query.  
MySQL is tool which uses SQL to perform various operations to databases
Eg: facebook, wordpress,joomla etc..,
alternatives: oracle,postgresql,sql lite,mssql server etc..,
4. Terminologies such as client vs server, schema etc..,
   Web or internet works with client-server model
   schema means structure
     Eg: Every student enters 
     SID  SNAME  EMAIL PHONE
     
5. How to install MySQL?
    
   step1: Goto Google type, "mysql free download"
   step 2: Goto https://www.mysql.com/downloads/ and mysql community GPL downloads
   step 3: select mysql installer for windows
   step 4: select second option and download
   step 5: no thanks, just download
   step 6. Goto downloaded file, double click
   step 7: allow permission (yes)
   step 8: select 'full' and next and execute
   step 9: setup 'server' and set password and confirm
   step 10: setup router with password

mySQL can be interacted by 
  i. GUI Tool (workbench): workbench is graphical user interface tool to interact with mySQL server and it is easy to understand and maintain
  ii. command line client: command line client is command line interface tool to interact with mySQL server and it takes time to master since everything needs to be in commands.
  
basic commands to create and delete databases are:
1. create DB: create database database-name;
2. delete DB: drop database database-name;
