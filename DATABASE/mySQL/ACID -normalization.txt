ACID Properties: These are the standards that a transaction follows:
A transaction means any action on db.
  i. Atomicity: A transaction must be always single unit
     like full complete or not complete
  ii. consistency:A transaction always move from one state to another state. 
 iii. isolation:  every transaction must be isolated from each other. one transaction should not disturb other transactions
  iv. durability: once a transaction is commited it is permantly saved in database. even in the system failure

 employee management: 
i . once you insert a employee, all details should be inserted at a time
ii. employee status should be displayed as online,offline or stay away
iii. one employee insertion should not disturb another employee insertion
iv. even after deletion/system crash, once a commit is done, its permanaent


Normalisation:
Normalisation sets rules to divide a big table into small tables such that 
RDBMS maintains well.
sid  sname   scourse   course_fee   email_id   faculty_name  faculty_phno


sid sname email_id cid fid

cid scourse course_fee

fid  fname faculty_phno

i. 1NF: every column in table must be atomic
eg: courses:  html,css,javascript  is invalid
course1: html, course2:css, course3:js is valid

ii.2NF: table should be in 1NF, all non key columns  are fully dependent on primary key

iii. 3NF: table should be in 2NF. there should not be any transitive depenency.

iv. BCNF: bcnf  requires that every determinant must be a candidate key. boyce-codd. bcnf will be for strong database
