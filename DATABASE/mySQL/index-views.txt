Procedures in mySQL:
A stored procedure in mySQL is a set of SQL statements that you can save and reuse

syntax: 
---------------------------
  delimiter $$
    create procedure procedure-name(parameters)
     begin
          //query logic
     end
  $$ delimiter ;
--------------------------------
call procedure-name(argument)

--- in parameters name and data type are required

functions:  function is similar to stored procedure but always returns a value . functions will not be called like stored procedures but will be used in SQL statements like
select, update,delete etc..,

create function function_name(parameters)
returns return_type
begin
   ///logic
   return value;
end;
